    <p>This course covers the fundamental concepts and techniques of full-stack web development, 
        focusing on server-delivered front-end content such as server-rendered HTML or JSON and

    <p>My name is Ming Xie, and I'm a software engineer with a passion for creating remarkable user experiences and 
        building high-performance products. I'm excited to be your instructor for this course, and I look forward to working with you!</p>
